Hello All,

Welcome to the class!

A few notes to make the on-boarding process as simple as possible here...

Definition for "assigned" homework:
    - Any new thread/topic posted from me
    - And you have not yet post anything in it yet

How to finish your homework:
    - Read it.
    - Post a "Done" message in the thread.

How not to be just the "minimalist of an observer":
    - Share your questions
    - Share your solutions
    - Post anything you feel helpful to others (no memes please)
 
Since Google Groups is actually designed to be an "email solution",  the web forum part is only a friendly provided "side" feature. You should still focus in your inbox at most time. It might be a good idea to put a bit of control on the flood of incoming messages:
    - (Optional) Setup email filters in your inbox

Last but not least, not only the "techniques" worthy of learning, but also the ability to ask for help and provide help to the others. The teamwork, in my humble opinion, is the best feature of human society.

Also remember, a teacher's ultimate goal is to equip and level up the students so they could eventually get rid of the teacher. Try to be a bit ambitious. :o)

All my good wishes to you all,
Han
