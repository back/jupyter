Task 1 - Onboarding to USACO website
---
You will have to register 2 online user accounts at USACO website.

1)  http://usaco.org/
    - You should, or highly advised to, use your real name to create a login here.
    - This login will be used later this year to take Copper/Silver/Gold tests.
    - Your score will be marked by the name you used in registration here.
    - However, we will *not* use this login during our training camp.

2) https://train.usaco.org/
    - Feel free to register by any name.
    - Your training progress will be marked here.
        - Each solutions submitted will also be evaluated by the virtual machine on this site.
    - This one is the main battle field for us.

Reply "Done" when you are able to login for both sites.

Task2 - File I/O
---
- How to read the inputs from a file
- How to write the answers to a file

The above 2 skills/knowledge are NOT a testing purpose in USACO competition. However, they are CRUCIAL to solve any of the challenges, since each question requires your code to read inputs from a test case file, and dump your answer in another newly created file.

So, please make sure you have learned how to do File I/O before our first class starts. I am not planning to teach it during the online sessions due to tight schedule (unless half of the class is asking for it)

With that in mind, please demonstrate your ability of File I/O in a short program:
    - Read in a few numbers saved in a multiple-line text file
    - Calculate the summary of them
    - Write the answer to a newly created text file

Reply under this thread with your code link (hastebin.com is recommended).
    - Choose your language freely among: Java, C++, Python, Pascal
    - Choose your input/output file names at will
    - Only the code is required, no need to past input/output text files

Feel free to ask, share, or communicate within your team.

Task3 - First Submitting
---
- Log in to USACO Training Gateway
- Read Section 1.1, so you can see the contents of next section

Now in Section 1.2, read the first link: TEXT Submitting Solutions

Modify your code just created in "Task 2 - File I/O", make it:
    - Read in a file named: "test.in"
    - Read in two numbers from the first line
        - They should be separated by a space
    - Calculate the summary
    - Write the answer to a file named: "test.out"

Most important:
    - Put a 3-line "comments" in the beginning of your code. Make it read as:

ID: <your_id_here>
TASK: test
LANG: JAVA

    - Replace <your_id_here> with your real login user id !!!
    - If you are not using JAVA, replace the last line with correct words:
        - PYTHON3, PYTHON2, C, C++, PASCAL

Now scroll down to the bottom of the page:
    - Click the "Choose File" button and choose your code from your PC
    - Click the "Send it in!" button to submit it to the USACO grading machine

Reply "done" after you see "Congratulations" from USACO Training Gateway.

Task4 - Reading the PROB
---
USACO Training Gateway Section 1.2 has 4 PROBs:
    - Your Ride Is Here
    - Greedy Gift Givers
    - Friday the Thirteenth
    - Broken Necklace

Read them all.
    - No need of rushing to the solutions yet.

This is not a coding task, but rather an English reading challenge. Make sure you are getting familiar with the USACO's narrative style. It is quite essential to your future exams. In anyway before working on a problem, we have to make sure everyone understood what questions are asked and what answers are wanted.

Please Reply done when you are confidence enough to describe all of them with your own words in simple English. (Try, though optional, explain the questions to one of your parents. See if you can state it clearly.)
